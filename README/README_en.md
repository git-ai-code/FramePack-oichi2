# FramePack-oichi2 (Beta) | [Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](../README.md) | [ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh.md) | [–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π](README_ru.md) | [Issues](https://github.com/git-ai-code/FramePack-oichi2/issues)

**FramePack-oichi2** (aka: Oichi-Two) is a video generation one-frame inference image generation tool created as a separate tool within the same repository as [git-ai-code/FramePack-eichi](https://github.com/git-ai-code/FramePack-eichi). It was built upon nirvash's [nirvash/FramePack](https://github.com/nirvash/FramePack), which is a fork of lllyasviel's [lllyasviel/FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack). The stability of LoRA functionality was improved by incorporating code from Kohya Tech's [kohya-ss/FramePack-LoRAReady](https://github.com/kohya-ss/FramePack-LoRAReady), and then enhanced with the [1-frame inference](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/blob/main/docs/framepack_1f.md) proposed by the same author and the kisekaeichi feature proposed by furusu. The project further implements mattyamonaca's proposed 1f-mc (1-frame multi-control) method on an experimental basis, with overall source code review and additional features.

```

## üåü Main New Features and Improvements

### üîß **Latest Update (v0.1.0-pre)**

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **LoRA File Upload Strength Settings**: Added individual strength input fields for each file in the upload version
- **Improved Resolution Prediction Display Accuracy**: Fixed display order of predicted size width√óheight format for consistency

#### Processing Logic Improvements
- **Optimized Seed Management for Queue Features**: When using prompt queue and image queue, seed values are fixed; seed+1 is applied only during normal batch processing.

‚ÄªFor conventional features, please refer to the [oichi user guide](https://github.com/git-ai-code/FramePack-eichi/blob/main/README/README_userguide.md#oichi%E7%89%88%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%95%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E7%89%88%E3%81%AE%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%84%E6%96%B9).

### üéØ **4-Mode Integrated Control System**
- **One-frame inference**: Simple next-frame generation using only input images. Performs the most basic image generation using one-frame inference from video generation. Control images are ignored during processing, focusing purely on temporal prediction.
- **Kisekaeichi**: High-precision image transformation technology using reference images, conceived by furusu and implemented by Kohya. Uses only kisekae control images and masks, optimized for clothing and appearance changes using LoRA and other techniques.
- **1-frame Multi-control (1f-mc) (Experimental)**: Advanced image blending technology using multiple control images, proposed by mattyamonaca. Combines person control images with additional control images to achieve more complex and precise image generation.
- **Custom**: High-flexibility mode that uses all configured control images and masks simultaneously. Suitable for experimental purposes or when trying unique control methods.

### üìã Improved Operability Through Terminology Unification
- **Complete Resolution of Duplicate UI Issues**: Unified the overlap between "Target Index" and "Latent Index" into a single "Generation Frame Position (latent_index)"
- **Standard Terminology Unification**: Compliant with official FramePack terminology. "History Index" ‚Üí "Reference Frame Position (clean_index)" etc.

### üìä **Execution History System**
- **Complete Settings Restoration**: Automatically saves all parameters (prompts, LoRA settings, advanced control settings) for one-click complete restoration
- **Thumbnail History Display**: Automatically generates thumbnails of input images, output images, and control images for visual history management
- **Parameter Comparison Feature**: Supports optimal parameter adjustment by comparing with past settings
- **Automatic File Management**: Prevents file loss during history restoration by persisting control images and mask files
- **Maximum 20 Records Retention**: Automatically manages the last 20 execution histories with automatic deletion of old records
- It's located at the top, though it's easy to miss.

### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- Support for variable LoRA count up to 20. Expanded preset management from 5 to 10 presets.
- Improved code maintainability through modularization

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Setup Instructions**

#### **üìã Pre-Setup Notes**

**üö® Recommended Folder Separation**
- FramePack-oichi2 strongly recommends construction in an **independent folder**
- Even if you have existing FramePack-eichi, please construct in a **separate folder**
- While overwriting existing environments is technically possible due to modular separation, it's **not recommended** to avoid unexpected behavior or configuration conflicts

**üìÅ Recommended Folder Structure Example**
```
C:/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ framepack(-eichi)/      # FramePack(-eichi) (existing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ framepack-oichi2/       # FramePack-oichi2 (new creation, recommended)
```

**üéØ About Model Sharing**
- **Model files** (approximately 30GB) can be shared between multiple environments
- You can specify an existing model folder during first startup "Model Storage Location Specification"
- Example: `C:\Models\hf_download` or `C:\framepack\webui\hf_download`

**Step 1: Official FramePack Environment Setup**

1. **Download**
   Download from [Official FramePack](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack) by clicking **"Click Here to Download One-Click Package (CUDA 12.6 + Pytorch 2.6)"**.

2. **Extract and Setup**
   ```batch
   # Recommended: Extract to dedicated folder (e.g., C:\framepack-oichi2)
   # Execute the following in the extracted folder:
   
   update.bat  # Required: Apply latest updates

   ‚ÄªIf Windows displays "Windows protected your PC", click "More info" and select "Run anyway".
   After execution, press any key to close the window.
   ```

3. **Model Download Confirmation**
   - **For now, skip this process (explained later)**
   ```batch
   run.bat     # First startup begins model download (approximately 30GB)
   ```
   - Models will be automatically downloaded approximately 30GB on first startup
   - Models are saved in the `framepack\webui\hf_download` folder
   - If you have existing models and want to move them, place them in this folder

4. **High-speed Library Installation (Recommended)**
   ```batch
   Download package_installer.zip from [Issue #138](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack/issues/138)
   Extract and run in the FramePack root directory:
   package_installer.bat

    ‚ÄªIf Windows displays "Windows protected your PC", similarly click "More info" and select "Run anyway".
    After execution, press any key to close the window.
   ```

**Step 2: FramePack-oichi2 Overlay Installation**

#### **üéØ Important: Overlay Installation Method**

FramePack-oichi2 is designed as an **overlay package**. It adds or overwrites all or minimum necessary files on top of the official FramePack.

1. **Executable File Placement (Minimum Required)**
   Place the following file in the FramePack root directory:
   ```
   run_oneframe_ichi2.bat             # FramePack-oichi2 startup script
   ```

2. **File Placement in webui Folder**
   Place the following files and folders in the `webui` folder:
   ```
   webui/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oneframe_ichi2.py              # Main application
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version.py                     # Version management
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oichi2_utils/                  # oichi2-specific utilities (18 modules)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diffusers_helper/              # Important: Only 2 files
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bucket_tools.py            # Resolution bucket functionality
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.py                  # Memory management functionality
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common_utils/                  # Common utilities
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lora2_utils/                   # LoRA processing utilities
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ locales/                       # Multi-language support
   ```

**Step 3: First Startup and Model Configuration**

**Initial Setup and Future Startup Method**
1. Open the FramePack-oichi2 folder
2. Start with `run_oneframe_ichi2.bat`

#### **üéØ Model Storage Location Setting (Important)**
A HuggingFace model storage location setting screen will be displayed on first startup:

```batch
============================================================
HuggingFace Model Storage Location Setting
============================================================
Models not found. Please set storage location.
If you have an existing shared folder, enter that path.
(Example: C:\Models\webui\hf_download or /home/user/models/webui/hf_download)
Press Enter without input to use local folder.
------------------------------------------------------------
Model storage path:
```

**üìÅ To Share Existing Models (Recommended)**
```batch
# Use existing FramePack or FramePack-eichi models
Example 1: C:\framepack\webui\hf_download
Example 2: C:\framepack-eichi\webui\hf_download  
Example 3: C:\Models\hf_download (shared folder)
```

After setting, it will be recorded in `FramePack-oichi2\webui\settings`'s `app_settings.json` as:
```batch
  "hf_settings": {
    "shared_model_paths": [
      "ÔΩû\webui\hf_download"
    ],
    "local_model_path": "hf_download"
```
You can modify as needed or delete and restart to specify again.

**üÜï For New Download**
- Press Enter on blank to use local folder (`webui\hf_download`)
- Approximately 40GB new download will begin

**‚ö° HuggingFace Authentication**
- Authentication screen is automatically skipped (no authentication required)

**Step 4: Automatic Model Download**
- Progress will be displayed in console
- WebUI will start automatically after completion

#### **üîÑ If Above Steps Don't Work**

**Alternative Procedure: Setup via Official Route**
1. Start official FramePack normally in a **separate folder** and complete model download
2. Overlay FramePack-oichi2 files (or copy to new folder)
3. Start with `run_oneframe_ichi2.bat`
4. Specify existing model folder on first startup (e.g., `C:\framepack\webui\hf_download`), or press Enter on blank

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note: About Direct Overwriting on Existing Environments**
- Direct overwriting on existing FramePack-eichi is technically (probably) possible
- However, it's **not recommended** due to risks of configuration conflicts and module interference
- Troubleshooting becomes difficult in case of issues
